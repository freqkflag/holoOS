# 🧠 Self-Hosted PaaS with Local LLM & Agentic AI

A modern, open-source, self-hosted PaaS platform that combines container orchestration, an app store, and agentic AI capabilities powered by local LLMs.

Inspired by:
- **CasaOS** – Modular plugins and simplicity
- **Umbrel** – App store and one-click deployments
- **Dokploy** – PaaS-style app management
- **Deepin OS** – Sleek, polished UI

---

## 🚀 Features

- ⚙️ **App Store UI** with one-click deployment of containerized apps
- 🧠 **Local LLM Integration** via llama.cpp, Mistral, or TinyLLaMA
- 🤖 **AI Agents** for deploying, scaling, monitoring, and generating infrastructure code
- 📦 **LXC/Docker** container management backend
- 💬 **Chat-based assistant** for natural language commands
- 🔐 **Authentication + 2FA** and secure action logging
- 📁 **YAML-defined apps** with version control and schema validation
- 🔄 **Auto-recovery** and rollback system for container failures
